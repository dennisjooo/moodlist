## 🔧 Implementation Considerations

### Database
- Minor schema additions (no breaking changes)
- Migration: Alembic (already set up)
- Expected: 5-10 new tables/fields

### Backend
- Reuse existing LLM infrastructure
- Build on recommendation engine
- API versioning not needed (additive changes)
- ~100 hours total backend work

### Frontend
- React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 (already set up)
- Component-based architecture
- Existing design system can be extended
- ~100 hours total frontend work

### Infrastructure
- No new services needed for Phases 1-2
- Phase 3 might benefit from task queue (optional)
- Caching beneficial for analytics
- Mobile app would require app store setup
